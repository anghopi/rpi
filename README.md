# rpi

I successfully designed and implemented a water detector using a Raspberry Pi.
The project aimed to detect water in the basement during flooding and alert the homeowner by generating a sound using a piezo buzzer.
Additionally, I utilized the Twitter API with Python to automatically post a tweet, notifying the homeowner about the leak in the basement.
Thus by subscribing to the Raspberry Pi Twitter account the homeowner has instant notification of an adverse flood event.
The algorithm monitored the feedback from the owner, and if it received none, it continued to notify every 30 minutes to ensure that 
this emergency is not ignored.

Throughout the project, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with GPIOs, resistors, and a multimeter.
I also utilized a mixed signal oscilloscope for troubleshooting and fine-tuning. To create and model portions of the the circuit,
I effectively utilized LTspice to create the schematic. Moreover, I configured a Raspberry Pi with an operating system, 
a version of Linux, and configured it to ensure seamless integration and reliable performance with my application. 
This configuration involved loading relevant libraries such as GPIO control, Python, and the Twitter API. 

To showcase my work and facilitate collaboration, I documented the project on GitHub. 
This project provided me with a deeper understanding of hardware-software integration, Python programming,
and project management skills, as well as my aptitude for problem-solving and learning new technologies.
